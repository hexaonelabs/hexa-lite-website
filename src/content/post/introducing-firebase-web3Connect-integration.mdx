## Why Firebase Web3Connect as Wallet provider?

### Enhancing Transparency and Decentralization
At HexaOne Labs, we are committed to upholding the core principles of blockchain technology: <b>transparency & decentralization</b>. [Firebase Web3Connect](https://web3connect.web.app) aligns with these principles by providing a robust, secure, and non-custodial authentication method. This means that users retain full control over their private keys and seed phrases, enhancing the overall security of their digital assets.

### A Fully Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet
One of the key features of Firebase Web3Connect is its support for a <b>fully 100% non-custodial & multi-chain wallet</b>. This integration allows users to manage multiple cryptocurrencies across different blockchains networks within a single wallet interface. By eliminating the need for third-party custodians, we are ensuring that your assets remain under your control at all times.

### Developed by HexaOne Labs Core Team
The integration of Firebase Web3Connect has been developed in-house by our <b>dedicated core team at HexaOne Labs</b>. This ensures a seamless integration with <a href="https://hexa-lite.io">Hexa Lite</a> and all our existing systems and guarantees that we can provide prompt support and updates. Our team's deep understanding of the platform enables us to optimize the performance and security of the new authentication system.
