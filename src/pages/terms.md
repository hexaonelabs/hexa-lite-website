and monitor a user’s portfolio of virtual currencies and interact with decentralized
protocols and applications (e.g., virtual currency markets, boards, or interfaces allowing
for financial transactions). The Wallet can be created by using the third-party service
provider https://magic.link. The user must at all times keep the Wallet, the related access
credentials (e.g., private keys, pin codes and passwords) and the associated computing
devices safe and secure. Hexa Lite bears no responsibility for any unauthorized access of
the Wallet. HEXA LITE DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO VIRTUAL CURRENCIES IN THE

Transaction; (ii) have control over networks or virtual currencies; (iii) ensure that any
transaction details the user submits or receives through the Platform can be confirmed on
the network; (iv) facilitate cancellation or modification requests; or (v) assist the user with
any financial or technical advice pertaining to the Transactions or the Platform.

### 3.3 Hexa Lite’s role.
Hexa Lite is not a cryptocurrency exchange, broker, intermediary, advisor, agent, or

use of the Platform. Hexa Lite further: (i) does not assume responsibility for any
advancements in cryptography which could render inoperative cryptographic algorithms;
(ii) makes no guarantees as to the security of any networks; (iii) makes no warranties as to
the markets in which decentralized finances are traded; (iv) is not liable for any hacks,
double spending, stolen currencies, or any other attacks on any network; (v) is not liable
for any hacks or malicious attempts to obtain access to the Wallets; (vi) is not party to or
responsible for any illegal activity the user engages in when using the Platform; (vii) takes
no responsibility for the Transactions that may not be completed, modified, canceled, or
are substantially delayed, or fail; and (viii) is not regulated by any regulatory agency and is
not subject to the examination or reporting requirements of such agencies.

of the Platform, including, without limitation, any authorized or unauthorized access to

time and such changes may materially alter networks, virtual currencies, the
